<h2>The debut studio album by the British ska-pop group Madness, released by Stiff Records. Recorded and mixed in about three weeks, the album peaked at number two and remained on the U.K. Albums Chart for more than a year. The album has received much critical praise. It was ranked 90th in a 2005 survey held by British television's Channel 4 to determine the 100 greatest albums of all time.</h2>

            THIS IS your Editor speaking. in accordance with the latest Government cutbacks, we have decided to economise on a proper single reviewer and make do with Steve Bush instead.
(Thanks for nothing - Steve
Bush). (Agreed - Smash Hits
Readers). C'mon, Stevie boy, say
"Hello Fans...
<p>
    Now, let's see . .. which is the A-side? Ah yes - the fast nutty ska instrumental that's really hard to keep still to and ends about 5 minutes too soon.
    The B-side is "Mistakes" slower and this time with vocals and some Shadow-like guitars.
    Great sleeve and the 1979 Smash
    Hits Award for the prettiest labels.

<h2>California
    Uber Alles (Fast Product). What,
    Anarchy in the USA? This
    "controversial" American band
    has been talked about for ages,
    but I can't understand why. The
    drums and bass at the beginning
    promise a possible goodie, but
    everything quickly merges into a
    flat, messy fuzz. Horrible voices,
    daft words. I'd sooner listen to
    Jimmy Carter.

    <h2>Ads (Polydor). Isn't it nice to have all those wonderful T.V. ads back again? No? Well anyway, that's what Twist's second single is all about.
        Buggles found success with a seemingly odd subject, and although "Ads" isn't as strong it could certainly be a hit, especially with the Costello-style backing vocals.
        And nobody can say it's not commercial (hee hee).</h2>

                    Ow you say eet - ze formula is wearing thin? Large stretches of adequately danceable synthesised German disco punctuated by awful English lyrics, the occasional nearly cetchy chorus and chanted vocals. Strictly production line stuff - I expect they make 17 of these in a day. In short, about as imaginative as the title. Best tracks: "My Simple Heart' "Red Light". (4 out of 10).</h2>
