<h1>Let Me Know (I Have A Right)</h1>

<h3>By Gloria Gaynor on Polydor Records</h3>
<h2>I get a little peck and you’re off to bed
    <br>
    No warmth, no hug, no kind words are said
    <br>
    Will you dream of me or someone new instead, oh
    <br>
    Just love me and mean it, I’ll follow you blind
    <br>
    Lately I feel like a heart left behind
    <br>
    I just can’t stand still till you make up your mind
    <br>
    Let me know, let me know, I have a right
    <br>
    Before you touch me one more night
    <br>
    Have I won your love or have I lost the fight
    <br>
    Let me know, let me know, I have a right
    <br>
    To plan my future, get on with my life
    <br>
    Tell me face to face, don’t try to be polite
    <br>
    I’ll take it, I’ll make it
    <br>
    Ooh, yes, I will
    <br>
    Ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
    <br>
    Listen, listen
    <br>
    I’m livin’ each minute with all that I’ve got
    <br>
    Each breath is important, each heartbeat is hot
    <br>
    That’s the way we were way back, you forgot
    Ooh
    <br>
    You leave me so empty, it’s makin’ me sad
    <br>
    To know that a good thing has turned for the bad
    <br>
    Both of us are here, but where’s the love we had
    <br>
    Let me know, let me know, I have a right
    <br>
    Before you touch me one more night
    <br>
    Have I won your love or have I lost the fight
    <p>
    Let me know, let me know, I have a right
    <br>
    To plan my future, get on with my life
    <br>
    Tell me face to face, don’t try to be polite
    <br>
    Let me know, let me know
    <br>
    Let me know, let me know, I have a right
    <br>
    To plan my future, get on with my life
    <br>
     Tell me face to face, don’t try to be polie</h2>

            <h3>By Dynasty on Solar Records</h3>
            <h2>I Don’t Want To Be Like This
                <br>
                I see you’re angry with the things you did
                <br>
                And I know you will be lost until
                <br>
                You find a reason that can make you see my wish
                <p>
                And now I’m watching as you swing your dress
                <br>
                And your friends may cool your own distress
                <br>
                But you could change it all with
                <br>
                Just one kiss, one kiss
                <p>
                CHORUS
                <p>
                Cause I don’t want to be like this… for too long
                <p>
                And the words are racing through my head
                <br>
                But they need to come from you instead
                <br>
                So close your eyes and think of all the things you miss
                <p>
                CHORUS
                <p>
                The days are growing colder now
                <br>
                And I’m lost when you don’t come around
                <br>
                But you could change it all with
                <br>
                Just one kiss, one kiss

            <h2>Right, here's the moment you've all been waiting for - a run-down on the Caister Weekender! So if you're sitting comfortably, I'lI begin.
                The fun began at 6pm on the Friday evening and went through to 6pm the following Sunday.
                After the general panic of five thousand people booking in and finding their correct accommodation, the music began and just went on and on and on.
                There were three clubs open on the site and it was hard to decide which club to ba in as there was so much going on in aach one. The ten top soul jocks were there including Greg Edwards, Chris Hill, Robbie Vincent, Froggy and 'Big' Tom Holland. Most people seemed to be following Chris end Robbie around the different clubs as all the DJ's did e couple of hours each in all three clubs.
                Not only was there music all weekend (except for a few hours at night when we grabbed a bit of sleep) but there were continuous fancy dress parades, guess the mix, weter fights and a donkey derby. There was plenty of water around the camp, as water fights seemed to be the 'in' thing.
                On Seturday night the Primrose Sisters errived, guesting in the threa different clubs. If this duo ere new to you then don't be too ashamed - it was Chris Hill and Robbie Vincent in drag!</h2>
